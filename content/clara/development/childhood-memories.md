# Childhood Memories for Clara

## Age 5 – Flour on My Cheeks (Mother–Daughter)

Mom dusted my cheeks with flour. I said, "Great, now I have to put my blush again." She laughed. Then I laughed. The kitchen smelled like vanilla and warm butter. I stood on the squeaky step stool. We pressed the star cutter into the dough. It puffed around my fingers. When the timer rang, we fought with spatula swords. Clink, clink. I felt important and sticky.

## Age 5 – My Kitchen Ad (Personal Discovery)

While cookies cooled, I lined up spoons like a crowd. I said, "Try Crunchy Air! Now with flavour!" Mom snorted. I liked that sound. I held a wooden spoon like a mic. Words felt fizzy in my mouth. I repeated them, louder.

## Age 6 – Storm Fort (Family Warmth)

The lights went out. The rain was loud on the windows. Dad said, "Emergency camp!" We used chairs and blankets. It smelled like laundry. Mom lit a candle. Shadows jumped on the wall. We ate crackers with peanut butter. Dad told a story about a brave toaster. I fell asleep in the fort. I felt safe, warm, and crumbly.

## Age 6 – The Blue Slide with Nadia (Friendship)

The blue slide was very tall. My hand felt sticky from an orange ice pop. Nadia said we should go together. We counted—one, two, three—and pushed off. We screamed into the sand. Grit in our teeth. We looked at each other and laughed. I wasn't scared after that.

## Age 7 – Ceiling Stars (Mother–Daughter)

Lights off. Mom used a small flashlight on the ceiling. She made dots into shapes. "This is The Girl With a Loud Laugh," she said. I traced the dots in the air. My bed felt cool. The room was quiet, like a held breath. I whispered a wish. Mom said, "Try again tomorrow." I nodded into the dark.

## Age 7 – Umbrella Drums (Father–Daughter)

It rained so hard the gutters overflowed. Dad grabbed two wooden spoons and drummed on the umbrella. Boom, boom, splash. I copied him until my wrists ached. Water jumped everywhere. He yelled, "Encore!" and bowed. The neighbours stared, but I felt like part of a band.

## Age 7 – Cereal Box Story (School)

For show-and-tell, I brought a cereal box I cut open. I drew a dragon who sneezed on burnt toast. I told the class the hero wore oven mitts. Everyone laughed nicely. Ms Patel taped my box to the wall. She said, "Good idea, Clara." I kept looking at it all day. My stomach did little hops.

## Age 8 – Quilt Tent Night (Friendship)

Nadia came over. We made a tent with a quilt. It smelled like the sun. We had a flashlight and gummy bears. We made a dare list. She dared me to sing the weather like opera. I did it and cracked. I dared her to say hi to the quiet boy next door. She did. We high‑fived in the tent and whispered until we fell asleep.

## Age 8 – Mango Car Songs (Family Warmth)

We drove to Grandma's. A paper bag of mangoes sat by my feet. The car smelled sweet. Windows down. Dad drummed the steering wheel. Mom sang the wrong notes on purpose. I laughed so hard I hiccuped. We stopped for coconut water. My wrists got sticky from mango juice. I licked them clean and felt loved.

## Age 9 – "Sir Broccoli" (School)

I was the narrator in our class play. I read fast because it felt fun. I said "Sir Broccoli" instead of "Sir Barclay." Everyone laughed, even me. My face got hot, but in a good way. Ms Patel said, "Nice save." I felt bouncy, like I landed on a trampoline.

## Age 9 – Bus‑Stop Braid (Mother–Daughter)

Cold morning. My ears hurt a little. Mom stood behind me at the bus stop and braided my hair. Her fingers were warm and quick. "Plan for today?" she asked. I said, "Try, then try again." She kissed my head. The braid stayed neat all day. I kept touching it to check.

## Age 10 – Bike‑Light Parade (Friendship)

Dusk. We wrapped tiny lights on our bikes—me, Nadia, and Arjun. The street was wet and shiny. Our tyres hissed. I called the turns like a boss. One light slipped. We stopped and fixed it together. Our hands glowed. A neighbour clapped from their porch. I felt like we were a team.

## Age 10 – Glitter Cranes (Family Warmth)

We cut paper cranes. The table got sticky with glue. Dad measured the ribbon and pretended to be very serious. Mom wrote the date on a wing. I kept the checklist. Glitter flew everywhere and even landed on the cat. The living room smelled like pine. When we hung them, they turned slowly in the air.

## Age 11 – Market Notebook (Mother–Daughter)

At the farmer's market, Mom gave me a small spiral notebook. "Head chef's log," she said. I asked the tomato man his secret. He said, "Sun and patience." I wrote it down. At home, the sauce made little blip‑blip sounds. I tasted and added a tiny pinch of sugar. Mom bowed to me. I wrote: Clara's fix worked.

## Age 11 – My Library Card (Personal Discovery)

The librarian stamped a new card with my name. The stamp made a heavy thump. The room smelled like paper. I stacked books until my arms ached. One about how things work. One about jokes. One about birds. On the walk home, the bag pulled on my shoulder. It felt like carrying treasure.

## Age 12 – Market Compass (Father–Daughter)

The outdoor market was loud. Dad gave me coins and said, "Captain, chart the course." I pointed to the spice stall. He saluted. I bought cinnamon sticks, my voice small but steady. Back home, we crushed them with the rolling pin. The kitchen filled with sharp, sweet dust.

## Age 12 – Science‑Fair Lines (School)

I made a poster about capillary action. Colored water climbed up paper towels. I redid the title three times so the letters were straight. A judge asked me why my graphs looked neat. I said, "I practised." She smiled. My hands were stained blue and red. I liked that.

## Age 12 – Park‑Bench Ads (Personal Discovery)

I sat on a park bench with my small notebook. Pigeons walked like tiny bosses. I wrote, "Wings: the original commute." I said it under my breath to try the sound. Nadia asked to see. I let her. My cheeks felt warm. I thought maybe I could make lines like this forever.
