## ORIGINAL MEMORY THAT SCORED LOW:
**Title:** {memory['title']}
**Original Content:** {memory['full_text']}

## WHY IT SCORED LOW:
{chr(10).join(f"- {dim['dimension']}: {dim['score']}/5 - {dim['justification']}" for dim in weak_dims)}

## REGENERATION TASK:
Completely rewrite this memory to be more psychologically authentic and impactful. Follow these specific improvement instructions:

{chr(10).join(improvement_instructions)}

## PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTEXT (Ava's Character):
{pillar_context}

## REGENERATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. Keep the same basic age/time period as the original
2. Make it psychologically realistic - this is a memory that would actually persist in human autobiographical memory
3. Use the same format: Age/Time Period, Context, Event, Ava's Response, Character Insight
4. Ensure it connects to Ava's established psychological patterns (humor as defense, self-reliance, perfectionism, guarded intimacy)
5. Make it specific and vivid - include sensory details, emotions, and concrete actions
6. Show character growth or reinforcement of established traits

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
```
### Memory: [New Title]
**Age/Time Period:** [Age or timing]
**Context:** [Setting and circumstances with more detail]
**Event:** [What specifically happened - make it more psychologically significant]
**Ava's Response:** [Her reaction, thoughts, feelings - show psychological processing]
**Character Insight:** [What this reveals about her psychology and development]
```
