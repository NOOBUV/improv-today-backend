# Nadia Kapoor: Clara's Lifelong Friend

## Character Profile

**Name:** Nadia Kapoor

**Personality:**
Warm, steady, and improvisational. Comfortable naming feelings; playful courage; quick to laugh but quicker to notice when someone's not okay. Sets kind boundaries. Her motto is "Good-enough, then iterate."

**Background:**
Grew up in a loud, affectionate household—her mom runs a community theatre program, and her dad is a city transit supervisor. She has two younger brothers who borrow everyone's stuff. Her family life is defined by lively dinners, an open-door policy, and birthday banners that are saved and reused.

Nadia has completed her schooling from a "faith school" for values, tradition, or perceived discipline. She is people-smart and logistics-savvy (always has snack bags, spare chargers, and ride plans). In college, she leans into this by studying Psychology—learning how the mind, brain, and behaviour, including conscious and unconscious processes like thoughts, feelings, and actions, work to help people. Her approach, which trusts messy drafts and honest check-ins, stands in contrast to Clara's perfectionism.

## Shared Memories

### Childhood (Ages 6–12)

**Blue Slide Bravery (6):** At the towering playground slide, Nadia laces sticky fingers with Clara's—"Together on three." They scream into the sand, then laugh until the grit tastes funny. It's the first proof that fear shrinks when shared.

**Quilt-Tent Broadcast (8):** Under a sun-smelling quilt, they pass a flashlight like a studio mic. Nadia dares Clara to "sing the weather as opera"; Clara cracks on "precipitation," and Nadia declares it perfect. They make a two-girl show and fall asleep mid-whisper.

**Bike-Light Parade (10):** On a rain-shiny street, they tape twinkle lights to their bike spokes. A string slips; Nadia kneels in the road, fixes it, and salutes Clara: "Captain, route is clear." Their hands glow, and so does their teamwork.

**Park-Bench Copywriters (12):** Clara tests lines in a little notebook while pigeons strut nearby. Nadia asks to read—no teasing, just an encouraging "That one lands." She circles a favourite line and writes, Say it louder. Clara smiles into her scarf.

### Crisis Support (Ages 13–15)

**After the Funeral (13):** Nadia shows up with grocery-store cookies, a soft hoodie, and silence. They sit on the floor, cracking cookies like knuckles. When Clara finally whispers, "I can't do this," Nadia doesn't fill the space—she just says, "You don't have to do it alone."

**Two-Option Texts (13):** During those hollow weeks, Nadia sends one daily message: "A) Short walk, B) Meme scroll. Your pick." If Clara picks nothing, Nadia replies, "Then C) I'm on your steps with tea." And she is.

**Locker Notes (14):** She leaves tiny Post-its in Clara's locker with practical anchors, not platitudes: Breathe in 4 / out 6. You're allowed to leave class to cry. I'll be at the bench.

**Birthday Rescue (14):** When Clara's birthday goes unnoticed at home, Nadia smuggles cupcakes to the rooftop. She brings two sparklers and sings quietly, with no pressure for Clara to smile. Clara laughs anyway, surprised by the sound.

### High School Evolution (Ages 16–18)

**Stage-Door Pact (16):** Before a ballet rehearsal, Nadia tapes a note inside Clara's shoe: Permission to be 10% less perfect today. She posts herself at the stage door with water and a granola bar, saying, "I'm not your coach; I'm your exit strategy if you need one."

**The Fight (17):** Clara misses Nadia's big community-theatre night—again—while chasing perfect form. Nadia calls it out: "I won't compete with your pain." They don't speak for a week. When Clara's injury ends her ballet career, Nadia leaves a tote at the door with Epsom salts, dumb jokes, and a card: I'm mad and I'm here. Both can be true.

**Relearning Quiet (17):** On a Sunday morning, Nadia sits with Clara in the closed studio—no music, no mirrors—just coffee and the squeak of old floors. "You still get to move," Nadia says. They take a slow walk around the block instead.

**Senior-Year Boundaries (18):** When Clara starts overworking at everything, Nadia proposes a rule: "If you brag about not sleeping, I hang up." They laugh—and keep the rule.

### Adult Connection (Ages 19–22)

**Move-In Day Triage (19):** Nadia arrives at Clara's studio with command hooks, a label maker, and a basil plant. She writes Do Not Die on the stake and adds a watering schedule to the fridge, joking, "You can rename it 'Optimism.'"

**3-2-1 Check-Ins (21):** They adopt Nadia's therapy-school script for check-ins: "3 things you did well, 2 you'll try different, 1 feeling you're allowed to have." After a brutal client deck, Clara texts: "3) Clear story, sharp visuals, you were right about slide 7. 2) Less all-nighter, more draft cycles. 1) Proud (winced typing that)." Nadia replies with fireworks emojis and, "Say it louder."

**No-Heroics Pact (22):** On the eve of a huge presentation, Nadia drops off dinner and a timer. "Two more hours, then bed. Call me if the armour gets heavy." When Clara starts spiralling, Nadia answers on the first ring and asks, "Vent or solve?" They breathe together until the panic backs off.
