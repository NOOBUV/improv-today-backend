# Psychological Memory Evaluation Framework
## For Ava's Backstory Curation

Based on 2024-2025 research in autobiographical memory formation and retention.

## Core Psychological Principles

### Why Humans Remember Certain Memories

Human memory retention is not random. Research shows memories persist based on:

1. **Emotional Significance** - Strong emotions trigger neural consolidation
2. **Survival/Threat Relevance** - Evolutionary prioritization of safety-related information  
3. **Identity Formation** - Memories that shape self-concept and personality
4. **Autobiographical Reasoning** - Experiences that help explain "who I am and why"
5. **Self-Continuity** - Events that maintain coherent sense of self over time
6. **Meaning-Making** - Memories used to understand and process life experiences

## Evaluation Matrix

Each memory will be scored 1-5 across these dimensions:

### 1. Emotional Intensity & Valence
- **5**: Profound emotional impact (trauma, joy, breakthrough moments)
- **4**: Strong emotional content (significant happiness, sadness, anger)
- **3**: Moderate emotional resonance 
- **2**: Mild emotional content
- **1**: Emotionally neutral or flat

### 2. Survival/Threat Significance  
- **5**: Direct threat to physical/emotional survival (mother's death, abandonment)
- **4**: Major life disruption affecting security (father's withdrawal, ballet injury)
- **3**: Moderate challenge to stability or safety
- **2**: Minor stressor or uncertainty
- **1**: No survival/threat relevance

### 3. Identity Formation Impact
- **5**: Fundamental personality-shaping experience (first use of humor as armor)
- **4**: Significant character trait development (self-reliance, perfectionism)
- **3**: Notable contribution to self-concept
- **2**: Minor influence on identity
- **1**: No clear identity impact

### 4. Autobiographical Reasoning Value
- **5**: Core memory that explains major life patterns/behaviors
- **4**: Important for understanding personality development
- **3**: Contributes to life story coherence  
- **2**: Minor explanatory value
- **1**: Doesn't aid self-understanding

### 5. Memory Specificity & Vividness
- **5**: Highly specific with rich sensory details (sounds, smells, textures, visuals)
- **4**: Clear specific details with good sensory information
- **3**: Reasonably specific with some sensory elements
- **2**: Somewhat vague or generic
- **1**: Overly general or abstract

- **4**: Important social skill or understanding development
- **3**: Meaningful interpersonal learning
- **2**: Minor social insight

### 7. Developmental Timing Significance
- **5**: Critical developmental window (adolescence, major transitions)
- **4**: Important developmental period
- **3**: Moderate developmental relevance
- **2**: Minor timing significance
- **1**: No special developmental timing

### 8. Narrative Coherence & Connection
- **5**: Essential link between major life events/themes
- **4**: Important bridge connecting personality development
- **3**: Good connection to broader life story
- **2**: Loose connection to other events
- **1**: Isolated incident with poor narrative fit

### 9. Unconscious Processing Likelihood
- **5**: Memory that would be frequently mentally rehearsed/revisited
- **4**: Likely to be recalled and processed regularly
- **3**: Occasional mental revisiting
- **2**: Rarely consciously processed
- **1**: Unlikely to be mentally rehearsed

### 10. Psychological Defense Relevance
- **5**: Memory central to major coping mechanism (humor, self-reliance)
- **4**: Important for understanding defense strategies
- **3**: Contributes to psychological protection patterns
- **2**: Minor defensive relevance

## Quality Thresholds

### Premium Memories (Keep Definitely)
- **Total Score: 40-50** (Average 4-5 per dimension)
- Core memories that define Ava's psychological landscape
- Essential for understanding her personality and behavior patterns

### High-Quality Memories (Strong Candidates)
- **Total Score: 30-39** (Average 3-4 per dimension) 
- Important supporting memories that add depth and context
- Enhance character understanding and development

### Moderate Memories (Review Carefully)
- **Total Score: 20-29** (Average 2-3 per dimension)
- May provide useful detail but require strong justification
- Consider for inclusion only if they fill specific narrative gaps

### Low-Quality Memories (Likely Remove)
- **Total Score: 10-19** (Average 1-2 per dimension)
- Generic or poorly connected to character development
- Remove unless addressing specific plot requirements

## Character-Specific Evaluation Criteria

### Ava's Core Psychological Patterns (Weight heavily in scoring):

1. **Humor as Emotional Armor** - Memories showing development of sarcasm/wit as protection
2. **Self-Reliance from Abandonment** - Experiences that taught her to depend only on herself  
3. **Perfectionism & Self-Destruction** - Pattern of pushing too hard and burning out
4. **Guarded Intimacy** - Learning to protect herself in relationships while yearning for connection
5. **Creative Expression as Identity** - Finding self-worth through communication/marketing skills
6. **Complex Father Relationship** - Dynamic of loss, reconciliation, and conditional trust

### Trauma Processing Considerations:
- **Observer Perspective**: Traumatic memories should show emotional distancing 
- **Sensory Fragmentation**: High-trauma memories may have gaps or sensory overwhelm
- **Meaning-Making Evolution**: How Ava's interpretation of events changed over time

## Curation Process

1. **Score all generated memories** using the evaluation matrix
2. **Identify Premium and High-Quality memories** for definite inclusion  
3. **Check for psychological continuity** - ensure memories show believable development patterns
4. **Fill narrative gaps** with select Moderate memories if needed
5. **Remove contradictory memories** that don't align with established character patterns
6. **Organize chronologically** with thematic clustering
7. **Create final Backstory Corpus** with psychological annotations
