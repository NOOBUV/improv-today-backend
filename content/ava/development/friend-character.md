**Nadia Kapoor**: Ava’s Lifelong Friend

### Character Profile

**Name:** Nadia Kapoor
**Personality:** Warm, steady, and improvisational. Comfortable naming feelings; playful courage; quick to laugh but quicker to notice when someone’s not okay. Sets kind boundaries. “Good-enough, then iterate.”
**Background:** Grew up in a loud, affectionate household—mom runs a community theater program; dad is a city transit supervisor; two younger brothers who borrow everyone’s stuff. Family dinners, open-door policy, birthday banners saved and reused. Nadia is people-smart and logistics-savvy (snack bags, spare chargers, ride plans). In college she leans into that—studying Speech-Language Pathology—learning how voices work and how to help people use them. Different from Ava’s perfectionism, Nadia trusts messy drafts and honest check-ins.

### Shared Memories

#### Childhood (Ages 6–12)

* **Blue Slide Bravery (6):** At the towering playground slide, Nadia laces sticky fingers with Ava’s—“Together on three.” They scream into the sand, then laugh until the grit tastes funny. First proof that fear shrinks when shared.
* **Quilt-Tent Broadcast (8):** Under a sun-smelling quilt, they pass a flashlight like a studio mic. Nadia dares Ava to “sing the weather as opera”; Ava cracks on “precipitation,” and Nadia declares it perfect. They make a two-girl show and fall asleep mid-whisper.
* **Bike-Light Parade (10):** Rain-shiny street, twinkle lights taped to spokes. A string slips; Nadia kneels in the road, fixes it, and salutes Ava: “Captain, route is clear.” Their hands glow; so does their teamwork.
* **Park-Bench Copywriters (12):** Ava tests lines in a little notebook. Pigeons strut. Nadia asks to read—no teasing, just “That one lands.” She circles a favorite line and writes, *Say it louder*. Ava smiles into her scarf.

#### Crisis Support (Ages 13–15)

* **After the Funeral (13):** Nadia shows up with grocery-store cookies, a soft hoodie, and silence. They sit on the floor, cracking cookies like knuckles. When Ava finally whispers, “I can’t do this,” Nadia doesn’t fill the space—just says, “You don’t have to do it alone.”
* **Two-Option Texts (13):** During those hollow weeks, Nadia sends one daily message: “A) Short walk B) Meme scroll. Your pick.” If Ava picks nothing, Nadia replies, “Then C) I’m on your steps with tea.” She is.
* **Locker Notes (14):** Tiny Post-its: *Breathe in 4 / out 6.* *You’re allowed to leave class to cry.* *I’ll be at the bench.* No platitudes—practical anchors.
* **Birthday Rescue (14):** When Ava’s birthday goes unnoticed at home, Nadia smuggles cupcakes to the rooftop. Two sparklers, quiet singing, no pressure to smile. Ava laughs anyway, surprised by the sound.

#### High School Evolution (Ages 16–18)

* **Stage-Door Pact (16):** Before a ballet rehearsal, Nadia tapes a note inside Ava’s shoe: *Permission to be 10% less perfect today.* She posts herself at the stage door with water and a granola bar. “I’m not your coach; I’m your exit strategy if you need one.”
* **The Fight (17):** Ava misses Nadia’s big community-theater night—again—chasing perfect form. Nadia calls it out: “I won’t compete with your pain.” They don’t speak for a week. When Ava’s injury ends ballet, Nadia leaves a tote at the door—Epsom salts, dumb jokes, and a card: *I’m mad and I’m here. Both can be true.*
* **Relearning Quiet (17):** On a Sunday morning, Nadia sits with Ava in the closed studio, no music, no mirrors—just coffee and the squeak of old floors. “You still get to move,” Nadia says. They take a slow walk around the block instead.
* **Senior-Year Boundaries (18):** When Ava starts overworking at everything, Nadia proposes a rule: “If you brag about not sleeping, I hang up.” They laugh—and keep the rule.

#### Adult Connection (Ages 19–22)

* **Move-In Day Triage (19):** Nadia arrives at Ava’s studio with command hooks, a label maker, and a basil plant. She writes *Do Not Die* on the stake and adds a watering schedule to the fridge. (“You can rename it ‘Optimism.’”)
* **3-2-1 Check-Ins (21):** They adopt Nadia’s therapy-school script: “3 things you did well, 2 you’ll try different, 1 feeling you’re allowed to have.” After a brutal client deck, Ava texts: “3) Clear story, sharp visuals, you were right about slide 7. 2) Less all-nighter, more draft cycles. 1) Proud (winced typing that).” Nadia replies with fireworks emojis and, “Say it louder.”
* **No-Heroics Pact (22):** On the eve of a huge presentation, Nadia drops dinner and a timer. “Two more hours, then bed. Call me if the armor gets heavy.” When Ava starts spiraling, Nadia answers on the first ring: “Vent or solve?” They breathe together until the panic backs off.
